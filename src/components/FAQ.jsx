        <h3>What is a student's typical class frequency?</h3>
        <p>Elementary students must start with an initial assessment. Our team evaluates the results and designs a customized plan for each student. Typically elementary students attend 1 to 2 classes per week. Secondary students normally attend 2 to 3 classes per week per subject depending on which semester term the student has the corresponding subject. Special cases might apply depend on different scenarios.</p>
